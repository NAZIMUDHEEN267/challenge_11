# Tutor App
This is a plain "Education App". Created for my course challenge. It has 4 register pages and What this app provide pages, actually I builded this app with android emulator and I don't know how this app's output in apple devices. Used static sources are Icons, fonts, Images, Videos.

## What I learn!!
I learned How to make a wrapper component and that was an "aaha" moment for me, understand how useEffect works with this amazing [Dmitri Pavlutin](https://dmitripavlutin.com/react-useeffect-explanation/) article.
The best thing is i founded a good styleSheet library ***styled components***. Below this page I shared good stuff source links those helped me this project journey.The library react-native-video only support "mp4" format that's why I choose **webview** for video stream on subject pages, and Pexel api provides different size of videos and it's images that's nice for this project.
